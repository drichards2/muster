<p>Join ringers together using the power of the Internet</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Muster works by connecting copies of Abel by UDP in a peer-to-peer framework.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-the-name-mean-">What does the name mean?</h2>
<p>Muster = MUlti-SiTE Ringing</p>
<p>also</p>
<ol>
<li><em>to gather... in preparation for battle</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Everyone ringing needs a copy of Abel and Muster on a Windows machine. </p>
<h3 id="abel">Abel</h3>
<p>Abel is available for purchase at <a href="http://abelsim.co.uk/">http://abelsim.co.uk/</a>. Version 3.10.2 or later of the Windows version is required.</p>
<h3 id="muster">Muster</h3>
<p>Muster is available for download from <a href="releases\Muster 1.0.0.0.zip">here</a>. When it&#39;s downloaded, extract the files and run muster.exe. Make sure you sufficiently appease any anti-virus software, and ensure you give permission for Muster to communicate on public and private networks, otherwise the ringing won&#39;t go too well.</p>
<p>There is no charge for Muster, though please do consider making a donation to one of the following charities:</p>
<ul>
<li>CARE: <a href="https://www.careinternational.org.uk/">https://www.careinternational.org.uk/</a></li>
<li>Trussell Trust: <a href="https://www.trusselltrust.org/">https://www.trusselltrust.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ringing">Ringing</h2>
<p>Each time a band wants to ring:</p>
<ul>
<li>One ringer clicks &quot;Make a new band&quot;, and shares the generated band ID with everyone else in the band, who type it in the band ID text box.</li>
<li>Everyone clicks &quot;Join/refresh a band&quot;.</li>
<li>Once everyone has joined, one ringer clicks &quot;Start ringing&quot; which connects everyone together.</li>
<li>If the connections have been successfully created, everyone will see each other&#39;s status as &quot;Connected&quot;. If this step fails, try making a new band.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can then agree which each other which bells to ring, and each choose which bells the F and J keys ring. There are some conducting commands shown too which everyone will hear.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Abel is configured to have sufficient bells for what you&#39;re trying to ring.</li>
<li>Make sure you don&#39;t click away from Muster - a keypress when it&#39;s in focus will be sent to everyone else and also ring your local Abel.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t click &quot;Start&quot; in Abel. All the bells need to be controlled by key-presses from within Muster.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you run into any issues, please gather up the muster-debug-log.txt files generated in the same directory as Muster and send them to us so we can investigate.</p>
